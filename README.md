# Stock Market Symbols & Identifiers  

First off, I wouldn't clone the repo, just because it is quite large for what it is.  I usually will go to an individual file I need and download it as raw.  I think the final download was over 1 GB of data the last time I cloned it. 

Eventually I want to combine all the identifiers (i.e. cik, cusip, etc.) into one file, and then also add OpenFigi support as well
